The pizza dough was dry and crunchy, as if it had been overbaked. The sauce tasted bland and flavorless, like it came straight from a can with no spices added. The salami slices were rubbery and lacked any char or smoky flavor that good cured meats should have. Overall the pizza tasted very low quality, like it was made with cheap ingredients. \\n\\nI would not recommend getting the pizza salami from this restaurant. For the price I paid, I expected much better quality and flavor. The dough, sauce, and toppings were all subpar. I've had better tasting frozen pizzas! A good pizza salami should have a chewy, airy crust, zesty tomato sauce, and thin slices of peppery salami with a nice char. This pizza simply fell flat in all those departments. Unless the restaurant can seriously upgrade the ingredients and preparation, I will not be ordering this pizza again. It was a big disappointment and waste of money. I suggest getting something other than pizza salami here.\",\n",
       " 'comment': \" Here is a follow-up comment to the pizza salami review:\\n\\nI appreciate you taking the time to provide this detailed review of the pizza salami at this restaurant. It's very helpful for me and other potential customers to get an honest opinion on the food quality before trying it ourselves. I'm disappointed to hear the dough, sauce, and toppings were all subpar, especially at the price you paid. It's a shame because the restaurant itself has such a great atmosphere and friendly service. \\n\\nPerhaps it was an off night in the kitchen or they got a poor quality shipment of ingredients. I hope management takes your feedback seriously so they can improve the recipe and execution of this dish. A delicious pizza salami could be a signature menu item for them if made properly. For now, I'll take your advice and steer clear of ordering it based on your experience. I hope you'll come back again and try something else on the menu - it sounds like other offerings may be better. Thanks again for the candid review. Word-of-mouth from customers is so valuable for restaurants to learn and adapt.\",\n",
